# **CalvinHealiva**

## Vision Statement

According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, **85%** of college students have felt overwhelmed by everything they need to balance. From extracurriculars to courseload; relationships to personal time; this feeling of being overwhelmed can lead to, or increase, levels of _anxiety_ and _depression_ in students. Often these students do not feel comfortable revealing their identity. Unfortunately, the current system requires students to go in person to the Center for Counseling and Wellness to talk to a counselor. This is why **CalvinHealiva** will serve the community here at **Calvin University** in an alternate way by providing a free app that connects students to counselors with an option to connect anonymously. With their student IDâ€™s, Calvin students will have the option to seek counseling from certified counselors for free and have the benefit of remaining anonymous if they so desire.  

To better serve the community, we decided to create the app in Android Studio due to the time constraints related to this project. Since Android is one of the most commonly used mobile platforms and thus one with the most resources available, we decided to design and develop our project in Android Studio.
