Got an error saying that I need to set 'android.defaultConfig.vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true'
     I didn't change it as the code work as intended without needing to change it.


Got 21 typos but upon further inspection, none of them were really spelling mistakes so they were left as is.

Unused XML schema declaration. I followed the suggestion, and deleted the xml file that wasn't being used.

I got various suggestions to update the build gradle dependencies. I followed the recommendation to update them
     as it was a simple fix, and there really wasn't a reason to leave them on outdated dependencies.
